          <br>
          <br>This week we were tasked with programming the Arduino board to do something. I decided to build on my 3D printed pump from last week’s assignment and experiment with using sensors to control the speed of the pump.This would allow me to understand how I could eventually program my float switch to do the same thing with my final project.I also wanted to use what we had learnt in class about L9110 and experiment how I would use this together with a breadboard when powering a motor.<br>
          <br><u>Button component</u>
          <br>
          <br>I decided to first investigate with a button component that would change the direction of motion of my pump. This doesn’t provide much utility for me but I thought it would be a good starting point considering we went over the button function in class.<br>
          <br><u>Phototransistor sensor</u>
          <br>
          <br>My next goal was to program a phototransistor such that the pump sped up as more light was shone on it. I decided the most simple way to approach this would be to directly take the phototransistor sensor values and input that as motor speed.<br>
          <br><u>Constants</u>
          <br>
          <br>I started off by defining my constants as such:This time I needed 4 constants because I was including my L9110 A1A, A1B and the two pins for my button and sensor:<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> 3D Printing</span>
          <br>
          <br><u>First Print Test</u>
          <br>
          <br>I decided to print a small propellor to test the PRUSA printer. The slicing was fairly simple for this component since there were no overhanging parts. However, just to be safe I decided to add a brim. The print time was around 20 minutes and the results were good! The material seemed fairly strong and rigid so I concluded that it could be used as a propellor.<br>

          <br>
          <br><u>Printing Parts for my centrifugal pump</u><u>Bottom piece</u>
          <br>
          <br>This was my most complicated printing piece by far. For my first print I decided to put support everywhere and rotate the piece so that the bottom was were the dc motor would be placed later on. This created a print time of 3h40m. When my print was finished It was incredibly hard and time consuming to remove the slicing, especially from the circular tube (shown in previous designs). Once I had finished removing the support I realized my design had been scaled down in the printing process. I didn’t understand how this had happened at first but then I noticed that my prusa slicer software was on the mini prusa setting and not the Original Prusa MKS. This was incredibly frustrating!<br>
          <br>I reprinted the bottom piece, this time only placing support on the bottom of my component and flipping it so that the dc motor component would be printed last. This turned out much better, was faster by about an hour (2h30m), and the sizing was correct. Hooray!<br>
          <br><u>Propellor</u>
          <br>
          <br>This component was fairly straightforward as it was identical to my practice print only larger. The print time was 43 minutes minutes and there were no complications with slicing as no brim or support was needed.<br>
          <br><u>Top Piece</u>
          <br>
          <br>This component was also straightforward and only took 41 minutes. In hindsight however, I should have added a larger gap between the top and my propellor component. The spacing was too tight and preventing the propellor from spinning when I connected it to the motor. As a result I had to 3d print and extension between the bottom and top piece. Luckily this only took 10 minutes more.<br>

          <br><b>Lessons learnt with slicing:</b>
          <br>- Difficult to judge when to use support – can be very tricky to remove<br>- Experimented with different print times when flipping size<br>- Orientation is key<br>- If you are not using support make sure it is not being printed at an angle<br>

          <br>
          <br>I first tried to use the polycam 3d app scanner from the Appstore. This turned out terrible. I tried 2 more times and it was the same results. It could not distinguish the background from the intended scanning object.<br>
          <br>After I decided to use the Sense scanner in class. This was much more sophisticated and worked much better as shown below. I decided to scan something that looked like a potential body part I could use for pump design in the future. If I can scan shapes like this and import them as stls this will save me a lot of time designing in fusion!The stl file can be downloaded here:<br>
